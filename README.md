This is Callam Hartley's Next.js application to fulfill the requirements of Moustache Republic's Frontend Developer Test.

To run this application locally, you must have an active node.js environment on your machine. You may clone the repository and install packages with `npm install`.
Running `npm run dev` will start a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Took approx ~3 hours. Spent the most time fiddling with the cart dropdown css to get the borders lined up as in spec.
