This is Callam Hartley's Next.js application to fulfill the requirements of Moustache Republic's Frontend Developer Test.
I first opened the test details on 25/04/2024 at ~11am.

To run this application locally, you must have an active node.js environment on your machine. You may clone the repository and install packages with `npm install`.
Running `npm run dev` will start a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
